                <p>Parabola is a privately-owned property group based in Edinburgh and Newcastle with built accommodation throughout the UK and a select number of sites in development.</p>
                <p>As active investors we upgrade and reposition built assets that we acquire to improve their long-term income characteristics.</p>

                <h3 class="hide-on-mobile"><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
                <p>We deliver design-led mixed-use places that create best-in-class accommodation for occupiers while also providing amenity to the wider community. This characteristic is key to the Parabola way. Read more about how and why we develop places in our <a href="philosophy.html" data-pjax data-active-page="philosophy">Philosophy</a> section.</p>
